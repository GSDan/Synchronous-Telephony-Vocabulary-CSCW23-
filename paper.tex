\begin{abstract}
Multiple HCI projects have demonstrated the potential of digitally-enhanced, synchronous telephony platforms for use with and by resource-limited communities. However, these platforms were each designed to only facilitate a single archetype of community engagement, limiting their capacity for adaptation when contextual or stakeholder requirements change. This paper builds upon these projects to introduce a design vocabulary, grounded in a formal ontology describing the core components necessary to run adaptable, structured engagements through synchronous group telephony. Through a series of scenarios, we demonstrate how this design vocabulary can be used to: help design and communicate different models of synchronous audio engagements, describe existing technologies, and highlight other novel ways in which such platforms could be used. We discuss how while under-explored to this point, synchronous telephony platforms can be designed to orchestrate stakeholder engagements with a degree of flexibility previously impossible in remote, offline contexts.

% Multiple HCI projects have explored and demonstrated the potential of digitally-enhanced, synchronous telephony platforms for use with and by resource-limited communities. However, these platforms were each designed to only facilitate a single archetype form of community engagement—typically traditional talk shows with some audience interaction—limiting their capacity for adaptation when contextual or stakeholder requirements change. This paper examines the lessons learned from these projects, building upon them and the recent work surrounding object-based media to introduce Paroli: a flexible telephone conferencing system designed to facilitate the scaffolding of new formats of synchronous audio communication. Through a series of use-case scenarios and prototype deployments, we discuss and demonstrate how synchronous telephony platforms can be designed to orchestrate stakeholder engagements with a degree of flexibility previously impossible in remote contexts.
